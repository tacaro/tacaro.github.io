Historically, HABs have been used for meteorological measurements, observation, sampling of aerosols, and exposure of samples to upper atmosphere environments. The Earth’s stratosphere allows researchers access to a unique combination of wideband solar radiation, extreme cold, rarefied air, low humidity, and acute ionizing radiation—conditions that are relevant to space biology research. Here, we describe a reproducible payload for a HAB mission that can be constructed, launched, and retrieved for about \$3,000. This general standard operating procedure can be used by educators, community scientists, and research teams working with limited resources.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {To explore how airborne microbial patterns change with height above the Earth’s surface, we flew NASA’s C-20A aircraft on two consecutive days in June 2018 along identical flight paths over the US Sierra Nevada mountain range at four different altitudes ranging from 10,000 ft to 40,000 ft. Bioaerosols were analyzed by metagenomic DNA sequencing and traditional culturing methods to characterize the composition and diversity of atmospheric samples compared to experimental controls. The relative abundance of taxa changed significantly at each altitude sampled, and the diversity profile shifted across the two sampling days, revealing a regional atmospheric microbiome that is dynamically changing. The most proportionally abundant microbial genera were Mycobacterium and Achromobacter at 10,000 ft; Stenotrophomonas and Achromobacter at 20,000 ft; Delftia and Pseudoperonospora at 30,000 ft; and Alcaligenes and Penicillium at 40,000 ft. Culture-based detections also identified viable Bacillus zhangzhouensis, Bacillus pumilus, and Bacillus spp. in the upper troposphere. To estimate bioaerosol dispersal, we developed a human exposure likelihood model (7-day forecast) using general aerosol characteristics and measured meteorological conditions. By coupling metagenomics to a predictive atmospheric model, we aim to set the stage for field campaigns that monitor global bioaerosol emissions and impacts.},

Historically, most investigations examining the relationship between bioaerosols and UV conditions in the upper atmosphere have relied upon model-generated data. To address the shortage of in situ UV measurements in the upper troposphere and lower/middle stratosphere, we flew a meteorological balloon equipped with a UV radiometer and other core environmental sensors. The balloon payload launched from Illinois, USA, on October 6, 2018, and acquired UVA (315–400 nm) + UVB (280–315 nm) measurements for {\textasciitilde} 2 h up to 30.9 km. Above the atmospheric boundary layer, UVA + UVB values registered around 6 mW cm−2, results that were largely consistent with Tropospheric Ultraviolet–Visible model predictions. Performed in a low-cost, reusable manner with commercially available instruments, we show that reliable UV flux data can be acquired with meteorological balloon payload systems. This short communication provides relevant UVA + UVB results for aerobiology and astrobiology studies evaluating the survivability of microorganisms in the upper atmosphere.},

	abstract = {The rate at which microorganisms grow and reproduce is fundamental to our understanding of microbial physiology and ecology. While soil microbiologists routinely quantify soil microbial biomass levels and the growth rates of individual taxa in culture, there is a limited understanding of how quickly microbes actually grow in soil. For this work, we posed the simple question: what are the growth rates of soil microorganisms? In this study, we measure these rates in three distinct soil environments using hydrogen-stable isotope probing of lipids with 2H-enriched water. This technique provides a taxa-agnostic quantification of in situ microbial growth from the degree of 2H enrichment of intact polar lipid compounds ascribed to bacteria and fungi. We find that growth rates in soil are quite slow and correspond to average generation times of 14 to 45 d but are also highly variable at the compound-specific level (4 to 402 d), suggesting differential growth rates among community subsets. We observe that low-biomass microbial communities exhibit more rapid growth rates than high-biomass communities, highlighting that biomass quantity alone does not predict microbial productivity in soil. Furthermore, within a given soil, the rates at which specific lipids are being synthesized do not relate to their quantity, suggesting a general decoupling of microbial abundance and growth in soil microbiomes. More generally, we demonstrate the utility of lipid-stable isotope probing for measuring microbial growth rates in soil and highlight the importance of measuring growth rates to complement more standard analyses of soil microbial communities.},

Improvements in cell extraction, cell sorting, DNA sequencing, and techniques for detecting cell distributions and activity have revealed how the combination of lithology, permeability, and fluid mixing processes controls the diversity and heterogeneous distribution of microbial communities in fractured rock systems. However, the functions of most organisms, and the rates of their activity and growth, remain largely unknown. To mechanistically understand what physiochemical and hydrological factors control the rock-hosted biosphere, future studies are needed to characterize the physiology of microorganisms adapted to mineral-associated growth under energy- and nutrient-limited conditions. Experiments should be designed to detect synergistic interactions between microorganisms, and between microorganisms and minerals, at highly variable turnover rates. ▪The heterogeneous distribution of the rock-hosted biosphere is controlled by variations in porosity, permeability, and chemical disequilibrium. ▪Several imaging and chemical techniques can sensitively detect microbial activity within the rock-hosted biosphere. ▪The physiology and turnover rates of the subsurface rock-hosted biosphere remain poorly known.},

These imprints and our ability to detect them with advanced instrumentation hold the key to our understanding of the presence and abundance of life in the universe. Biosignatures are the chemical or physical features associated with past or present life and may include the distribution of elements and molecules, alone or in combination, as well as changes in structural components or physical processes that would be distinct from an abiotic background. The scientific and technical strategies used to search for life on other planets include those that can be conducted in situ to planetary bodies and those that could be observed remotely. This chapter discusses numerous strategies that can be employed to look for biosignatures directly on other planetary bodies using robotic exploration including those that have been deployed to other planetary bodies, are currently being developed for flight, or will become a critical technology on future missions. Search strategies for remote observations using current and planned ground-based and space-based telescopes are also described. Evidence from spectral absorption, emission, or transmission features can be used to search for remote biosignatures and technosignatures. Improving our understanding of biosignatures, their production, transformation, and preservation on Earth can enhance our search efforts to detect life on other planets.},

	abstract = {Measuring the growth rate of a microorganism is a simple yet profound way to quantify its effect on the world. The absolute growth rate of a microbial population reflects rates of resource assimilation, biomass production and element transformation—some of the many ways in which organisms affect Earth’s ecosystems and climate. Microbial fitness in the environment depends on the ability to reproduce quickly when conditions are favourable and adopt a survival physiology when conditions worsen, which cells coordinate by adjusting their relative growth rate. At the population level, relative growth rate is a sensitive metric of fitness, linking survival and reproduction to the ecology and evolution of populations. Techniques combining omics and stable isotope probing enable sensitive measurements of the growth rates of microbial assemblages and individual taxa in soil. Microbial ecologists can explore how the growth rates of taxa with known traits and evolutionary histories respond to changes in resource availability, environmental conditions and interactions with other organisms. We anticipate that quantitative and scalable data on the growth rates of soil microorganisms, coupled with measurements of biogeochemical fluxes, will allow scientists to test and refine ecological theory and advance process-based models of carbon flux, nutrient uptake and ecosystem productivity. Measurements of in situ microbial growth rates provide insights into the ecology of populations and can be used to quantitatively link microbial diversity to soil biogeochemistry.},

However, measuring the heterogeneity of microbial activity at the single-cell level, especially within complex populations and environmental matrices, remains a forefront challenge. Stable isotope probing (SIP) is a method for assessing microbial growth and involves measuring the incorporation of an isotopic label into microbial biomass. Here, we assess Raman microspectroscopy as a SIP technique, specifically focusing on the measurement of deuterium (2H), a tracer of microbial biomass production. We correlatively measured cells grown in varying concentrations of deuterated water with both Raman spectroscopy and nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (nanoSIMS), generating isotopic calibrations of microbial 2H. Relative to Raman, we find that nanoSIMS measurements of 2H are subject to substantial dilution due to rapid exchange of H during sample washing. We apply our Raman-derived calibration to a numerical model of microbial growth, explicitly parameterizing the factors controlling growth rate quantification and demonstrating that Raman–SIP can sensitively measure the growth of microorganisms with doubling times ranging from hours to years. The measurement of single-cell growth with Raman spectroscopy, a rapid, nondestructive technique, represents an important step toward application of single-cell analysis into complex sample matrices or cellular assemblages.},

Because isotopic discrimination during chemical reactions can be unique to specific chemical pathways or environmental conditions, isotopic patterns within a substance or between related substances may provide insights into their formation. Biosynthetic pathways can create isotopic patterns that differ from patterns that arise from abiotic processes, but this is not universally true. Isotope patterns are signatures of chemical reactions, so they require additional context to be used as biosignatures. The framework of the Life Detection Knowledge Base discussed herein is used to convey arguments that support or challenge the utility of isotopic patterns for life detection. Examples of carbon and sulfur isotopic patterns in organic materials and minerals are presented to indicate how the life detection criteria “prevalence” and “signal strength” can be applied. In future work, more abiotic processes that might create false-positive life detection claims must be characterized. A broader range of microbial communities, taxa, and biomolecules should be explored for isotopic patterns. Additional elements also warrant investigation as potential isotopic biosignatures and environmental indicators.

Though in the presence of enormous reducing power, life in serpentinizing systems is limited by oxidant and carbon availability. The forms of carbon that support the serpentinite-hosted microbiome, and their rates of biological assimilation, remain poorly understood. In this work, we quantify the habitability of subsurface environments shaped by serpentinization and examine the forms of carbon that support their microbial constituents, focusing specifically on dissolved inorganic carbon, acetate, and formate. We access reacted groundwater from the largest terrestrial serpentinizing body and measure carbon assimilation at the single-cell level. Across all conditions, we consistently observe robust assimilation of dissolved inorganic carbon into microbial biomass. Notably, we find that dissolved inorganic carbon supports the majority of methanogenic activity in the system, even at hyperalkaline conditions (pH {\textgreater} 11). Inferred bioenergetic fluxes suggest that rates of biological hydrogen-consumption and methanogenesis are relevant at the landscape scale. We identify a strong potential for the microbiome to be stimulated by increases in H2 and CO2, a finding with implications for the search for life on other planetary bodies and for the growing deployment of fluid injection technologies in ultramafic rocks, such as geological hydrogen production or carbon mineralization.},

	abstract = {Permafrost is at increasing risk of thaw as cold regions in the Northern Hemisphere continue to warm. Of particular concern is ice-rich, organic-rich, syngenetic “yedoma” type permafrost. The lability of organic carbon in permafrost post-thaw largely depends on the rate at which microorganisms resuscitate and proliferate after thousands of years in below-freezing, dark, anaerobic conditions. However, the resuscitation and growth rates of microorganisms in deep permafrost are unknown. To quantify these rates, we conducted lipid stable isotope probing (lipid-SIP) on permafrost cores collected from four locations within the Permafrost Tunnel near Fairbanks, Alaska. We compare rates of microbial growth, marker gene sequences, and greenhouse gas (CO2, CH4) emissions across cores held anaerobically at ambient and elevated temperatures. In deep, ancient permafrost, microbial biomass turnover is exceedingly slow, often undetectable, within the first month following thaw. Our results indicate microbial growth in response to anaerobic thaw has a notable lag period, where only 0.001 - 0.01\% of cells turn over per day. This suggests a ‘slow reawakening’ that could provide some buffer between anomalous warmth and C degradation if permafrost refreezes seasonally. However, within six months, microbial communities undergo dramatic restructuring and succession, producing communities that are distinct from both the emplaced ancient and overlying surface communities. These results have critical implications for predictions of microbial biogeochemical contributions in a warming arctic, especially as thaw proceeds into deeper and more ancient permafrost horizons.
Plain Language Summary Permafrost, earth material like soil, rock, or ice continually frozen for more than two years, contains more organic carbon than is currently in the atmosphere as CO2. As the Arctic warms and permafrost thaws, ancient microbes can reactivate, allowing the degradation of organic carbon that has accumulated in permafrost over millenia, resulting in the release of greenhouse gases. In this work, we measured the rates at which permafrost microorganisms resuscitate during thaw and related these growth rates to changes in microbial community composition and greenhouse gas emissions.
Key PointsMicrobial growth is extremely slow within the first 30 days of thaw. Temperature may drive which taxa are active, but not growth rates.Subsurface microbes show a preference for glycolipids over phospholipids, suggesting a possible cryotolerance adaptation.Ancient, entrapped gases may be the primary source of emissions in early thaw stages.},
