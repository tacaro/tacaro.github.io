The rate at which organisms grow is a simple yet profound parameter. Indeed, the growth and activity of microorganisms ultimately controls the habitability of our planet. Yet, measuring rates of microbial transformations in natural systems remains a core challenge in microbiology. How do we measure "the speed of life" in the multitude of microbiomes on the Earth? More importantly, how do we interpret this kind of kinetic information? These questions drive my research interrogating the links between microbial activity, biogeochemical cycling, and environmental change. I develop and apply isotopic and geochemical tools to quantify microbial activity in natural and engineered systems. I focus my efforts on fundamental challenges in global change and climate science, as well as applied problems in "exobiology" â€“ our effort to search for life beyond Earth.

I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences at Caltech, working with Profs. Alex Sessions and Smruthi Karthikeyan. I previously completed a Ph.D. with Profs. Alexis Templeton and Sebastian Kopf at CU Boulder, and a B.A. in Molecular and Cell Biology from UC Berkeley.
